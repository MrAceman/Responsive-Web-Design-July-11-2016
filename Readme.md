## Responsive Web Design - July 11, 2016

This HTML and CSS was created on July 11th, 2016. The goal was to make a simple responsive website.

The primary purpose of this exercise was to work on utilizing @media queries in CSS to dynamically change CSS rules based on the screen width.  This was approached using a "mobile first" design and adding rules as the screen size increased.
